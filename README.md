# password-generator
password generator using js

I used a long if else statement to check if the which depend on the prompts and confirms the user was given to describe the password they want.
    in these if elese statements I made a new array which corresponed with the bools
    Then I made a for loop that itterated the password length prompt amount of times and added a character to the password via a random index
        The random function was the length of the new array
I ran into a few bugs but I used console log and the dom to figure them out

I learned var newArray = oldArray.concat(AnotherArray) from the internet (W3 schools)

I used comments to space out and explain what I was doing.

THIS WEBAPP ASSUMES THAT THE USER WANTS LOWERCASE LETTERS IN THEIR PW
    !!!THE DEFAULT IS LOWERCASE LETTERS!!!
